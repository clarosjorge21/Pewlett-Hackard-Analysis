# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

### Overview of the Analysis
Our manager has given us two new assignments. The first is to determine how many employees are retiring per title and the second is to find out how many employees are eligible to participater in a mentorship program. We will then write a report to summarize our analysis and help Bobby's manager for the silver tsunami as employees reach their retirement age.

* Unfortunately, there are not enough qualified retirement ready employees to mentor the next generation. We currently only have 1,940 employees who are ready.
